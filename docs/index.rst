Translation Bundle
==================

SonataTranslationBundle allows you to easily translate your models in SonataAdmin
in every locale you need on your frontend.

This bundle adds a locale switcher block in :

* edit forms
* show actions
* custom actions

**Currently supported :**

* **ORM** : integrates Doctrine ORM entities with Gedmo extensions

In addition, it provides a nice global locale switcher for your admin.
